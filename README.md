# Sequelize Reverse Engineering Code 

## Overview and Purpose
- When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
- This tutorial is a walkthrough for developers to assist in understanding the code. 
- This code uses npm modules ‘express’, ‘passport’, ‘fs’, ‘path’ to help users create an account, login into that account and logout storing all data in a mysql database.

## User Story 
As a developer I want a walk-through of the codebase so that I can use it as a starting point for a new project.

## Step by Steps Code Guide 
1. Clone repo from github into VSS using gitbash terminal `git clone git@github.com:brc9087/Sequelize-Reverse-Engineering-Code-HW.git` 
2. Open Mysql workbench and create and use 3 databases (‘passport_demo’, ‘database_test’,  ‘database_production’) then press the lightning bolt to run the scripts in the database. 
3. Edit the `config.json` in the config folder → edit `‘development.password’, ‘test.password’, ‘production.password’` and input your personal mysql password. 
4. Go to Sequelize-Reverse-Engineering-Code-HW/develop → right click and open terminal → then run `NPM install` to install required modules
5. When installs complete, run `node server.js` to activate the app  
Go to the browser and type in `http://localhost:8080/` as web address. 
Enjoy!
